## What is Typescript?
**Typescript** is still JavaScript code but with added code to handle the *type system*.

The Typescript Type System:
- helps us catch errors during development
- uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
- only active during development
- doesn't provide any performance optimization

create a .ts file, and by running *tsc index.ts* in the command line, it creates index.js 
In the command line we can run *node index.js* and we see our first todo.

We can combine these steps by running *ts-node index.ts*.


## Writing out Typescript
**Interfaces** in typescript are used to define the structure of an object.
